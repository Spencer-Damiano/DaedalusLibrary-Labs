# Overview

This Obsidian Vault is where I will be keeping notes and records for idea about education technology, VR and AR tech, and possible implementations of both in the treatment of dyslexia. The goal is to use what I learn for general learning purposes but I think that starting with Dyslexia is both a niche and a personal interest for me, as I have dyslexia.

The hope is that once successful that the same technology can be used in treating nuero-typical people. An example of this is Dr. Alvin Liberman, who worked on an early reading machine to help WW2 veterans who were blinded by the war. In creating this technology he discovered the need for phonemic awareness being integral to learning to read and write. This just happens to be the same circuitry that is different in people with Dyslexia.

For more information on my philosophy toward approaching this technology see [[Project Visions and Timeline]]. This covers where I think how to best develop technology to be an aid and not a crutch. I think that like all good innovations it explains how to best create the next generation of this type of technology.

# Obsidian

Obsidian in a Markdown editor and note taking app. I've used it in the past and really found it's tools intuitive and liked how I could connect complex ideas together and reference them. I found it as a no brainer to use this product to organize my thoughts. Once this is more established as a portfolio piece I plan on using Obsidians Publish feature to host it as a website. 

### Plug ins used -

-  Templates
	- Allows me to create notes in a uniform format with meta-data easier
- Kanban
	- This allows me to visually see where aspects of the vault are and better organize my thoughts. I will try to stick to one Kanban board ([[LABS KANBAN]]) for simplicity reasons unless I feel that documenting and showing where things are makes more sense
- Annotator
	- This allows me to download and use pdfs to annotate them and take notes while doing so. This is obviously super helpful as I try to break down documents.
- Dataview
	- This allows me to write SQL like queries to quickly find notes or information that I am looking for.
- Advanced Tables
	- Used whenever I create tables in markdown to make them look better and easier to use.
- Obsidian Git
	- Used to interact and update my GitHub repo where I store this.
