### About the Arrow Project

The Arrow Project is an AI project where we take the technology that we use to train AI tools based around the customers that we have. For example, in the Flowmodoro technique we might show that certain tasks takes longer then other subjects. That might because of the time of day, if you are ahead or behind in that class, ahead or behind on other classes, or that you tend to be more distracted when studding.  Pointing out where these times are might help a student know how to study better. Another example is when developing a VR game going over phonics with dyslexics you could create a deep-fake of a students voice. By then manipulating certain variables you could then recreate the way a student hears their voice in their head, potentially helping retention. This project might eventually be split into different projects, however I think that by tailoring user data to create ai tools that become better as they become better is the way to not have humans become stupider because of AI. 

### Arrow Projects Name

The Arrow project got its name from the Greek image of 'Chiron's Arrow'. Chiron was a centaur who taught Achilles, Asclepius and Hercules. He was skilled in teaching and passing on skills to those he taught. I liked the idea of using AI as both the teacher and tool to become better.
