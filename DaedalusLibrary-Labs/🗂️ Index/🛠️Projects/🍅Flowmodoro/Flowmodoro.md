### About the Flowmodoro Timer

- The Flowmodoro is based of the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It's named after the Italian word for 'tomato', inspired by the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used when he was a university student. The technique is simple yet effective and is designed to improve productivity and focus. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Choose a Task**: Begin by selecting a task or series of tasks you want to work on.
    
2. **Set a Timer**: Set a timer for 25 minutes. This time period is known as a "Pomodoro," after the technique's name.
    
3. **Work on the Task**: Work on the task until the timer rings. It's important to stay focused on the task during this time; try to avoid interruptions or switching tasks.
    
4. **Take a Short Break**: Once the timer goes off, take a short break (typically 5 minutes). This is a crucial step, as it gives your brain a chance to rest and recharge before the next Pomodoro.
    
5. **Repeat**: After the break, start another Pomodoro. Continue the cycle of 25-minute work sessions followed by 5-minute breaks.
    
6. **Take a Longer Break**: After completing four Pomodoro's, take a longer break (15-30 minutes). This longer pause helps to ensure that your brain remains refreshed and can maintain a high level of productivity throughout the day.

- The Flowmodoro differs from the Pomodoro in that instead of focusing on a set time that you have to work, it focuses on trying to maintain a 'flow state.' Here is how it works
1.  **Choose a Task**: Begin by selecting a task or series of tasks you want to work on.
2. **Set a Stopwatch**. This is a way of trying to measure your flow, you are trying to get your stopwatch to count up 90 minutes, which is about the max that a human can focus on a task productively.
3. **Take a proportional break**. You take the time that you have been studding and divide that by 5, which is how long that you get to take a break for. The rules for taking a break are 
	1. You have to be studying for at least 5 minutes. The purpose of this rule is that usually after really focusing for 5 minutes that you have committed to the task at hand. You can extend or shorten this based on you discipline
	2. Take a break when you start to lose a sense of focus. If you find your mind wondering, or on your phone, or somehow on a YouTube video, start your break timer. Just try to find a good stopping place to come back to your work.
	3. You have to take break at 90 minutes. If you powered through all that you were working on you will loose your flow stat at around 90 minutes. Its best then to take a break before going back into a task.

### When to use Pomodoro or Flowmodoro

I am extremally biased to the flowmodoro technique as it focuses on increasing your focus time and is a way to measure improvement in your studies. However, I have how that if I don't want to do a certain bit of homework or have been avoid some menial task, pomodoro has been more effective. Sometimes after starting with a pomodoro I switch to the flomodoro or vice versa. It's a simple tool but it I think can be used to later predict length of assignment, distraction, and where you could improve.
