# Project Overview

## Daedalus Library - Labs
- This is a branch of a project that I started of a study website / YouTube Channel concept. I wanted to labs to be a place where future projects would later go. A sort of breeding ground for new ideas and projects that go under the mission of inventing technology to enable better learning. The labs is a site that serves as a journal of sorts. Not a peer-reviewed one, but a collection of ideas that hopefully will be acted on. Right now the "Arrow Project" and "Flomodoro Timer" are the two ongoing 'Lab' projects.



# Flowmodoro Timer

### About the Flowmodoro Timer

- The Flowmodoro is based of the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It's named after the Italian word for 'tomato', inspired by the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used when he was a university student. The technique is simple yet effective and is designed to improve productivity and focus. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Choose a Task**: Begin by selecting a task or series of tasks you want to work on.
    
2. **Set a Timer**: Set a timer for 25 minutes. This time period is known as a "Pomodoro," after the technique's name.
    
3. **Work on the Task**: Work on the task until the timer rings. It's important to stay focused on the task during this time; try to avoid interruptions or switching tasks.
    
4. **Take a Short Break**: Once the timer goes off, take a short break (typically 5 minutes). This is a crucial step, as it gives your brain a chance to rest and recharge before the next Pomodoro.
    
5. **Repeat**: After the break, start another Pomodoro. Continue the cycle of 25-minute work sessions followed by 5-minute breaks.
    
6. **Take a Longer Break**: After completing four Pomodoro's, take a longer break (15-30 minutes). This longer pause helps to ensure that your brain remains refreshed and can maintain a high level of productivity throughout the day.

- The Flowmodoro differs from the Pomodoro in that instead of focusing on a set time that you have to work, it focuses on trying to maintain a 'flow state.' Here is how it works
1.  **Choose a Task**: Begin by selecting a task or series of tasks you want to work on.
2. **Set a Stopwatch**. This is a way of trying to measure your flow, you are trying to get your stopwatch to count up 90 minutes, which is about the max that a human can focus on a task productively.
3. **Take a proportional break**. You take the time that you have been studding and divide that by 5, which is how long that you get to take a break for. The rules for taking a break are 
	1. You have to be studying for at least 5 minutes. The purpose of this rule is that usually after really focusing for 5 minutes that you have committed to the task at hand. You can extend or shorten this based on you discipline
	2. Take a break when you start to lose a sense of focus. If you find your mind wondering, or on your phone, or somehow on a YouTube video, start your break timer. Just try to find a good stopping place to come back to your work.
	3. You have to take break at 90 minutes. If you powered through all that you were working on you will loose your flow stat at around 90 minutes. Its best then to take a break before going back into a task.

### When to use Pomodoro or Flowmodoro

I am extremally biased to the flowmodoro technique as it focuses on increasing your focus time and is a way to measure improvement in your studies. However, I have how that if I don't want to do a certain bit of homework or have been avoid some menial task, pomodoro has been more effective. Sometimes after starting with a pomodoro I switch to the flomodoro or vice versa. It's a simple tool but it I think can be used to later predict length of assignment, distraction, and where you could improve.



# The Arrow Project

### About the Arrow Project

The Arrow Project is an AI project where we take the technology that we use to train AI tools based around the customers that we have. For example, in the Flowmodoro technique we might show that certain tasks takes longer then other subjects. That might because of the time of day, if you are ahead or behind in that class, ahead or behind on other classes, or that you tend to be more distracted when studding.  Pointing out where these times are might help a student know how to study better. Another example is when developing a VR game going over phonics with dyslexics you could create a deep-fake of a students voice. By then manipulating certain variables you could then recreate the way a student hears their voice in their head, potentially helping retention. This project might eventually be split into different projects, however I think that by tailoring user data to create ai tools that become better as they become better is the way to not have humans become stupider because of AI. 

### Arrow Projects Name

The Arrow project got its name from the Greek image of 'Chiron's Arrow'. Chiron was a centaur who taught Achilles, Asclepius and Hercules. He was skilled in teaching and passing on skills to those he taught. I liked the idea of using AI as both the teacher and tool to become better.
