# Update Review DLU 0.0.1
###### Flowmodoro Timer testing and issues


This was a good project, but one that kicked my butt. I am going to continue using TypeScript for the time being despite it kicking my trash. I think that despite it hurting me in the short term while making simple projects as things get more and more complex I think that it will be worth the transition. However if I cannot find out the bugs by next time I will switch to JavaScript. 

The next step is to fix the known bugs, improve UI, and add Pomodoro timer. Once that is done the To-Do lists and distraction lists will be added. 

### Progress
- Functioning stopwatch and timer
- Learned a lot about typescript and how to work with Django

### Bugs
- Still issues with the way that the functions are called. Gets stuck in an infinite loop or can only cycle through once

### Issues
- UI is ugly. 
	- still using the colors to differentiate between deferent parts of the timer.
	- No header or footer
	- Not even a logo
