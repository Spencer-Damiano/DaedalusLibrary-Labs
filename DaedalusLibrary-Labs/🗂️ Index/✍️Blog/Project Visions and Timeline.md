# Project Visions and Timeline
###### Where we are, where we are trying to go

Thank you for clicking on this Obsidian Vault. I have no idea where I am trying to go with the project but I feel perpetually pulled back into it each time returning to take the ball a little further. I don't know is this will be more of a personal journal, a company website, or internal docs yet. I'm going to briefly go over each project and talk about what it is and how it will relate to future work. I am hoping to have a functioning product and product base by the summer of 2025 when I graduate with my bachelors.

### Daedalus Library
#daedalusLibraryCom 

This was my original idea for a project in ed tech. I really enjoy using timers, soundscapes, music and study aids while working. I couldn't find something though that combined them all into one place. That is where I got the idea to build a web app that could do all those things. I have many different versions that I've started and either restarted or abandoned. Examples from my GitHub include - 
-  [Daedalus Library Dajango](https://github.com/Spencer-Damiano/Daedalus-Library-Django)
-  [Daedalus Library Alpha](https://github.com/Spencer-Damiano/Daedalus-Library-Alpha)
-  [countdown flip timer](https://github.com/Spencer-Damiano/countdown-flip-timer)

I eventually would commit to working with Django for my project which is still on going. This as a mother project for all others, including this Labs Vault. Because of it's scope I usually just update it with mini-projects as I go along. The plan is to have this be my senior project and hopefully the grounds into a graduate program.

### Flomodoro Timer
#flowmodoro 

This was based on some Tik-Tocs that I saw which I thought was interesting. They talked about how the Pomodoro technique falls short because it can interrupt a flow state. This  an be an issue when working on creative or problem solving skills where once you lose focus it might be hard to come back to the problem. This feature serves as the base of the Daedalus Library website, although we do offer a pomodoro timer for when that makes more sense. The hope is to add features on top of this to encourage better studying but also to measure distractions. 

This is the most developed feature and has a working prototype in [GitHub](https://github.com/Spencer-Damiano/Daedalus-Library-Django)


### Arrow AI
#arrowAi 

No developments has taken place on this yet, just in planning phase. This serves more as a end goal. The hope is to use user data to give them insights on how to best study. The reason that I am mentioning this with little to no development is a self-reminder to make sure I am designing these systems to eventually be something that an AI or ML model could understand. 

### Future Projects
- Pomodoro YouTube Video Creator
- VR Phonic Game
- Internal Voice AI
